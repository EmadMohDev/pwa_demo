 - install event. It runs when a service worker is installed. It's triggered as soon as the worker executes, and it's only called once per service worker.
 - Caching something on the browser can take some time to finish because it's asynchronous.
So to handle it, we need to use waitUntil() which, as you might guess, waits for the action to finish.

 /*
 -  we attach respondWith() to prevent the browser's default response. Instead it returns a promise because the fetch action can take time to finish.
 - And once the cache ready, we apply the caches.match(fetchEvent.request). It will check if something in the cache matches fetchEvent.request. By the way, fetchEvent.request is just our array of assets.
Then, it returns a promise. And finally, we can return the result if it exists or the initial fetch if not.
